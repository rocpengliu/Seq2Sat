# Seq2Sat


## Description 

**Seq2Sat** is a novel, multifunctional, ultra-fast, all-in-one and reads-to-report software to automatically score microsatellite/SSR from target sequencing.

## Key features of Seq2Sat

* **Multifunctional**: Seq2Sat can conduct genotyping for both microsatellite/SSR and SNPs from both target sequencing.


* **Ultra-fast**: ~ 1 second/sample using single thread.

* **Extremely low memory cost**: negligible ~ 0.1 MB RAM.

* **All-in-one**: Seq2Sat directly takes raw target sequencing reads as input and output genotype table without any intermediate file writing and loading, making I/O very efficient.

* **Reads-to-report files**: it generates genotype table, a htlm report containging figures and tables for genotype, sex identification, SNPs.

* **Easy to use**: requires minimal programing skills.


## Getting started
### Step 1. Install the software
Seq2Sat  is written in C/C++11 and can be installed on Linux or Mac OS X (with Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools installed). 
We have tested Seq2Sat on Ubuntu (16.04 LTS and above) and macOS Catalina.

```
git clone https://github.com/ecogenomicscanada/Seq2Sat
cd Seq2Sat
make clean && make
```

### Step 2. Run a small test 

```
cd testdata;
cat sample.txt| while read i j k l; do ../seq2sat --prefix ${i} -i ${j} -I ${k} --loc loc.txt --sex sexLoc.txt --var ssr -w 8 -V; done;

or for a single sample:
../seq2sat --prefix 49090_S9 -i 49090_S9_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -I 49090_S9_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz --loc loc.txt --sex sexLoc.txt --var ssr -w 8 -V;
```

### View the [result folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rra64i62m1nwsgeuz8xu0/h?dl=0&rlkey=bn6q6fll7n3wa48b2e40zgpct) or one [HTML report](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hq9exmm9qgr3cwu/49090_S9.html?dl=0) 
```
Seq2Sat generates multiple result files including genotype tables, sex identification files, and html report containing tables figures.
```


### Using a user-friendly websited based platform <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocpengliu/satanalyzer" target="_blank">SatAnalyzer</a> (<span style="color:red;">strongly recommend</span>)
```
Seq2Sat is a command-line based software for auto-scoring genotype. To help users without bioinformatics training and manually editing genotype, we have developed a user-friendly webisted based platform SatAnalyzer. It is running in a docker container and it is strong recommended to use it.
```
### Input files
#### 1. fastq.gz files of [raw sequencing reads](https://github.com/ecogenomicscanada/Seq2Sat/tree/master/testdata)

```
using -i to specify the read1 for single end reads
      -i 49090_S9_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
or -I to specify the reads2 if you have a paired end reads
      -i 49090_S9_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -I 49090_S9_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
```
if you have the [sample.txt](https://github.com/ecogenomicscanada/Seq2Sat/tree/master/testdata/sample.txt) file, you must have a tab seperated table consisting of 4 columns for PE reads or 3 columns for SE reads.

for PE reads
```
49090_S9    49090_S9_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz    49090_S9_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz   grp

#### 2. [loci file](https://github.com/ecogenomicscanada/Seq2Sat/tree/master/testdata/loc.txt)
loci file provides the sequence and other informations about locus name, primer squences, flanking regions and microsatellite repeat array region.
A loci file must have 8 columns seperated by tab. 
They are 1. locus name, 2. forward primer sequence, 3. reverse complementary reverse primer sequence (or reverse primer), 4. forward flanking region, 5. reverse flanking region, 6. microsatellite repeat unit, 7. number of repeat, 8. MRA region.

using --loc loc.txt to specify loc file (or --revCom if your reverse primer sequence is not reverse complentary reverse primer sequence)
